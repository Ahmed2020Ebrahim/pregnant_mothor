                <h3>Foods</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <p>Congratulations, you are now in the third month (or more correctly between 9 and 12 weeks of pregnancy). What a journey it has been so far! Is the feeling of euphoria, on discovering that you’re pregnant, giving way to practicality now?
            By now, it is probably just you – the mother – who remembers you are pregnant; most other people will have gone back to their normal lives, even the baby’s father. That’s just because the baby bump is not yet visible, and no one really notices the nausea, the constant peeing and insatiable hunger!
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>The 3rd Month Of Pregnancy Diet : Foods To Eat</h3>
            <p>By the third month, your nausea, sleepiness and hunger will have elevated immensely. Luckily, this is the last month that you will feel nausea, so you can look forward to relishing food in the forthcoming month. Your nipples are no longer sore and the cramping also reduces. Your weight should start to rise a tad more quickly as well.<br>
            The bad thing is that the secondary symptoms like irritability, food aversion and smell sensitivity might set in—but relax; these symptoms will bother only your near and dear, and thankfully not you! So here’s a to-do list of dietary recommendations for your third month.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>1. Vitamin B6 Rich Foods:</h3>
            <p>Chances are your nausea is at its peak during this month, which can make you feel blue and fatigued. Foods rich in Vitamin B6 help a lot by reducing nausea and boosting your moods. Incorporate citrus fruits, eggs, green leafy vegetables and potatoes in your diet to get a steady dose of this vitamin.</p><br><br>
            <h3>2. Fresh Fruits:</h3>
            <p>During pregnancy, it is best to stick to fresh fruits as the canned ones contain preservatives that can cause acidity. Fruits are an arsenal of vitamins, so choose fruits of all colors; they contain water, natural sugar fiber and antioxidants too. You can add fruits that encourage weight gain now (bananas and guavas leading the chart).</p><br><br>
            <h3>3. Carbohydrates:</h3>
            <p>Once enemies of your thin waistline, carbs now become a lifeline for your demanding baby. By adding whole grain and simple carbs like bread, atta, rice and potatoes to your diet, you can gift a treasure of energy-boosting carbs to your baby. Remember, snacking on complex sugars (pastries, chocolate etc) will endanger you for being obese later.</p><br><br>
            <h3>4. Meats:</h3>
            <p>If you are a meat eater, now is the time to go berserk over them. Just make sure that the meat is cooked very well and is prepared with good hygiene. Chicken, mutton and fish (fresh water) are excellent sources of minerals, proteins and a whole lot of good taste!</p><br><br>
            <h3>5. Iron And Folate:</h3>
            <p>These twin elements are so vital for the foetus that ignoring them can cause moderate to severe mental and physical retardation in the foetus! Make sure that your diet provides you with rich sources of both and to do that, add Beetroot, chikoo, oatmeal, bran, tuna (tinned), beans and meats (for iron) and Oranges, Potatoes, Broccoli, Eggs and Greens (for folate) to your diet.</p><br><br>
            <h3>6. Dairy Products:</h3>
            <p>This is true for your entire pregnancy, as well as for the time you breastfeed: Milk and milk products stored safely and pasteurized properly are your best bet for a healthy baby. The foetus needs calcium and minerals found in milk products, so don’t deny it milk, curd, cheese and ghee.</p><br><br>

                <h3>Drinks</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Experts are still unsure exactly how much – if any – alcohol is completely safe for you to have while you're pregnant, so the safest approach is not to drink at all while you're expecting.</p>
            <h3>Is it safe to drink alcohol when pregnant?</h3>
            <p>The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum.
            Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink, the greater the risk.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does alcohol affect my unborn baby?</h3>
            <p>When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta and to your baby.
            A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop and does not mature until the later stages of pregnancy.
            Your baby cannot process alcohol as well as you can, and too much exposure to alcohol can seriously affect their development.
            Drinking alcohol, especially in the first 3 months of pregnancy, increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and your baby having a low birthweight.
            Drinking after the first 3 months of your pregnancy could affect your baby after they're born.
            The risks are greater the more you drink. The effects include learning difficulties and behavioural problems.
            Drinking heavily throughout pregnancy can cause your baby to develop a serious condition called foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
            Symptoms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>poor growth</li>
                <li>distinct facial features</li>
                <li>learning and behavioural problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drinking less heavily, and even drinking heavily on single occasions, may be associated with lesser forms of FAS. The risk is likely to be greater the more you drink.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How to avoid alcohol in pregnancy</h3>
            <p>It may not be as difficult as you think to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy, as many women go off the taste of alcohol early in pregnancy.
            Most women do give up alcohol once they know they're pregnant or when they're planning to become pregnant.
            Women who find out they're pregnant after already having drunk in early pregnancy should avoid further drinking.
            However, they should not worry unnecessarily, as the risks of their baby being affected are likely to be low.
            If you're concerned, talk to a midwife or doctor.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>What is a unit of alcohol?</h3>
            <p>If you do decide to drink when you're pregnant, it's important to know how many units you are consuming.
            One UK unit is 10 millilitres (ml) – or 8 grams – of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>just under half a pint of cider (218ml) at 4.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label)</li>
                <li>just under half a pint of beer (250ml) at 4% ABV</li>
                <li>a single measure of spirit (25ml), such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV</li>
                <li>just under half a standard glass of wine (76ml) at 13% ABV</li>
            </ul><br><br><br>

    <div class="weekinfo bg-light p-5" id="Sports">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="title1">
                <h3>Sports</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            
            <p>Exercise is a crucial part of a healthy pregnancy, and being in shape improves overall health and helps ease fatigue during labor and delivery. Sports may have been an important part of your life prior to pregnancy, but many sports and activities may not be that safe for pregnant women. </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>The basic rules of exercise during pregnancy</h3>
            <p>When choosing exercise during pregnancy, find an activity that increases heart rate to a moderate level without exhausting the body or increasing core body temperature too high. Take precautions when doing certain water activities. Elevated body temperature, whether from exercise or fever, is associated with an increased risk of birth defect. Also remember to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid exercise with a high risk of falling.</li>
                <li>Avoid outside exercise on hot days.</li>
                <li>Avoid contact exercise, including contact sports.</li>
                <li>Avoid exercise at high altitudes.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <h3>Good sports/bad sports</h3>
            <p>When it comes to choosing good sports and bad sports for pregnant women there is a little leeway for female athletes. For instance, a woman who runs marathons regularly can stay active during pregnancy by running marathons, as long as there are no pregnancy complications. Starting your marathon training after finding out you are pregnant is not the best idea, especially if you have never tried a marathon prior to pregnancy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Good Sports: Running, jogging, swimming, walking, tennis, golf, cycling, and bowling. These sports tend to be relatively low impact or low risk of falling.</li>
                <li>Bad Sports: Football, skiing, skateboarding, rock climbing, roller skating, scuba diving, weightlifting, and mountaineering. These sports tend to be high-impact or high risk of falling.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <h3>Exceptions to the bad sports rule</h3>
            <p>Creating a straight list of good sports/bad sports is not as clean-cut as you may think. A woman who lifts weight regularly may be given permission by her obstetrician to lift during pregnancy. Typically, weight lifting, in moderation, is safe as long as there is no history of pregnancy complications or miscarriage. Your doctor or midwife will work with you to define your good sports/bad sports. <br>

            Some sports, on the other hand, are never safe during pregnancy. Scuba diving, for instance, requires depressurization of the body. The fetus cannot depressurize as well as an adult, and evidence shows an increased risk of fetal complications when a pregnant woman practices scuba diving during her pregnancy. <br>

            Sports are a great way to stay in shape and keep a healthy, lean body during pregnancy, but not all sports are safe. The general rules of safety are simple: if there is a high impact/risk of falling, skip the sport.<br>
            Dangerous sports are those with increased injury risk to the body. When trying to conceive and during pregnancy, you want your body well protected and you don't want to endanger the pregnancy. Some of these you may not find to be a problem, however, any activity that has an increased risk of bodily harm, in addition to injuring you, can also affect the pregnancy and potentially lead to complications such as fetal injury and preterm delivery, to name only a few.
            </p><br><br>

            <h3>Activities and sports during pregnancy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Boxing</li>
                <li>Bicycling</li>
                <li>Baseball/Softball</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <h3>Can I Box Or Take Boxing Classes During Pregnancy?</h3>
            <p>Boxing is a great aerobic activity, and its popularity is increasing. Boxing is an ideal stress reliever (what other sport allows you to punch your way to serenity?). You not only get some cardio in but you also build arm muscle. Many women can benefit from strength training, especially as you age and muscle strength naturally lessens. Boxing classes also foster mental strength, independence, and defense training. There is no reason that you cannot enjoy boxing throughout your pregnancy, as long as you make some significant modifications as your pregnancy progresses.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Don’t Engage In Person-to-Person Combat</h3>
            <p>Hitting a punching bag is vastly different than engaging in boxing with another person in which you can get injured. During pregnancy, you must guard your body and your belly in particular from any unnecessary blows or injuries. Even if you agree to only throw punches on the upper part of the body, the potential for harm to the baby still exists. Do not box during pregnancy in the traditional way but only do it without anyone hitting you. If you are accustomed to boxing with another person, pregnancy is the time to use a punching bag for your regular workouts.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Watch Out For Signs Of Exhaustion</h3>
            <p>Fatigue is one of the most common early pregnancy signs and you may not have the stamina you did before getting pregnant due to rising progesterone levels in the first trimester. However, fatigue may subside with your second trimester, yet it will likely resurface later as you get closer to delivery. Carrying around all that extra weight can make you tire easily in the third trimester. Boxing is an exhaustive sport and more frequent breaks may be necessary during pregnancy.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate</h3>
            <p>Hydration is essential during pregnancy whenever you exercise. Especially when the exercise is as intense as boxing. You should drink some water every 10-15 minutes to ensure you do not get dehydrated.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Before You Start</h3>
            <p>Make sure you come equipped with loose-fitting clothing that is not restrictive. Wear a good pair of running/exercise shoes, which will help keep your balance.  Make sure you are not exercising on an empty stomach, which could cause a drop in blood sugar and a general feeling of unwellness.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Know When To Stop</h3>
            <p>If you have any dizziness, shortness of breath, or feel light-headed, immediately take a break to sit down or lie down on your left side, and drink water. If you become overheated, stop boxing. Increasing core body temperature above 101 degrees may cause hyperthermia. If the symptoms persist, consult your doctor.
            Working out in a structured exercise program is beneficial to you whether you are expecting or not. Unless you have pregnancy complications, have a high-risk pregnancy, or your doctor/midwife has immediate concerns regarding exercise, you can feel free to continue enjoying physical activity and exercise as long as you are careful.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>Bicycling During Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>Exercise has been thought to help prevent gestational diabetes, make labor much easier, and prepare your body for a quick recovery. If jogging was your usual form of exercise before your pregnancy, you could keep jogging until such time as you feel uncomfortable at doing so.  If swimming is your preferred workout and you swam forty laps each day, by all means, continue your routine until you can no longer do it.
            However, you should try to avoid any sort of high-risk activities because sports that can potentially harm you can also harm your baby. In a majority of cases, doctors usually indicate that biking is of no benefit to the baby; you can get just a good of a workout with a safer exercise or sport. The potential to fall and cause injury to your belly is just too great to risk it.
            Even though many women have claimed to be biking well into their second trimester without any problems, one quick plunge from your bike could easily cause trauma to your stomach, which could injure the baby, or placenta, or lead to premature labor. Keep in mind also that the further along the pregnant women is the greater the threat to the baby would be should a fall happen.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>Balance Is An Issue</h3>
            <p>Balance is a large issue during pregnancy, particularly in the advancing months. In early pregnancy, hormonal shifts cause many women to feel lightheaded and dizzy which raises your potential for falling. In the second and especially the third trimester, your center of gravity from your growing belly will be off and your regular balance while riding can be largely unsteady.
            As the pregnancy develops, it becomes more difficult and riskier to ride and in your final trimester, it may become complicated to maintain your balance thus introducing additional possible falls from off your bike.
            If you are very fond of biking or if you are training, or simply would like to keep up your regular biking routine, you can safely enjoy riding a stationary exercise bike while pregnant. That way you can get in your preferred exercise while ensuring safety for you and your baby.

        <div class="container">
            <div class="title1">
                <h3>Tests</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <h3>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</h3>
            <p>Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become routine prenatal care in the United States. Some states even require that all pregnant women and/or their newborns be tested. Treatment begun during pregnancy can prevent the disease in the child and improve the mother's health as well. Even so, not all women receive routine prenatal care or are offered the test during pregnancy, acknowledges the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and some women do not agree to have the test. Ideally, the woman will have the blood test as part of her pre-conception care or early in the pregnancy. This best protects the mother and baby.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Screening the mother: All pregnant women in the United States should be counseled about HIV early in their pregnancy and receive voluntary HIV testing to protect the child’s health. This is the recommendation of many groups, including the U.S. Public Health Service, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Repeating the test in the third trimester is of value to those at high risk for HIV infection.</li>
                <li>Screening the baby: In the United States, if the mother’s HIV status is not determined before or during pregnancy or during labor and delivery, healthcare practitioners recommend that the newborn be given an HIV test within 24 hours of the birth (in a few states, this is a requirement; see Newborn Screening). Treatment begun within 48 hours of birth helps prevent a baby who was exposed to the virus from becoming infected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). If a pregnant woman is infected with HIV, the virus can be passed to and infect her baby.<br>
            The screening tests detect HIV antigen (p24) and/or HIV antibodies in the blood. The combination HIV antibody and antigen test is the recommended screening test for HIV. It is available only as a blood test. By detecting both antibody and antigen, the combination test increases the likelihood that an infection is detected soon after exposure. Some screening tests detect only HIV antibody. These tests are 
            available as blood tests or tests of oral fluid.<br>
            If the screening test is positive, it must be followed by a second antibody test that is different than the first test. If the second test does not agree with the first test, then a third test is performed that detects the genetic material (RNA) of the virus.<br>
            If a woman's confirmatory tests indicate an HIV infection, she will want to consult with her healthcare provider before becoming pregnant about the risks of infecting a baby and the effects of the pregnancy on her health. Treatment of HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, precautions at birth, and avoiding breast-feeding can minimize the risk of passing the infection from mother to child. Giving the antiretroviral drug zidovudine intravenously during labor and delivery and also to the newborn twice a day by mouth for 6 weeks reduces the rate of transmission from 25-33% to about 1-2%. A combination of antiretroviral therapies is most effective at reducing the risk of HIV transmission to the baby.<br>
            A negative test for the antibody to HIV may mean that there is no infection or that a sufficient amount of the antibody has not yet been produced to be detected. If a woman participates in high-risk activities that may transmit HIV, such as unprotected sexual contact or intravenous drug use, she should be retested one or more additional times during the pregnancy.
            </p>
            <h3>Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Screening</h3>
            <p>Infection with hepatitis viruses causes inflammation of the liver. People with acute hepatitis B or hepatitis C may have symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and jaundice. Most people will get better without any intervention, but some may develop a chronic infection. Some of those chronically infected will have progressive liver damage that can lead to liver cancer and death.<br>
            Hepatitis B: the hepatitis B screening test is called hepatitis B surface antigen. It detects a protein produced by the virus and can detect a hepatitis B infection even before it causes symptoms. If a woman who is considering getting pregnant tests positive for hepatitis B, she should talk to her healthcare practitioner about how long she should wait to allow the infection to resolve before becoming pregnant.<br>
            It is important to detect active hepatitis B infections in pregnant women because newborns are especially vulnerable to developing chronic infection; up to 90% of those who become infected with hepatitis B in utero will become carriers. If a hepatitis infection is detected in a pregnant woman, she can be monitored and the baby can receive treatment at birth to minimize the risk of it developing hepatitis B.<br>
            A negative test for the virus means either that there is no current infection or there is not yet a sufficient amount of the antigen to be detected. If a woman participates in high-risk activities that may transmit the hepatitis B virus (such as unprotected sexual contact or intravenous drug use), retesting later in the pregnancy is generally advised.<br>
            Hepatitis C: though not common, hepatitis C can be passed from a mother to her baby. Screening of pregnant women is not routine but may be done if the mother is at risk of infection. Risk factors for hepatitis C include abusing intravenous drugs or having a sexual partner who abuses intravenous drugs, having a history of multiple sexually transmitted diseases, and being infected with hepatitis B.<br>
            Antibody tests are used to screen for the infection. Since the antibody test can remain positive in most people even if they have cleared the infection, a positive antibody test is followed by a hepatitis C RNA test, which detects genetic material of the virus. A positive result on the RNA test means the virus is present, the infection has not resolved, and the person may require treatment. The hepatitis C genotype test determines which type of virus is present to help guide treatment
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>Urine Culture for Asymptomatic Bacteriuria</h3>
            <p>Several organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recommend that pregnant women be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria using a urine culture between 12 and 16 weeks gestation or at the first prenatal visit, if later (ACOG recommends first prenatal visit and repeated in the third trimester). <br>

            Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is diagnosed when significant amounts of bacteria are found by urine culture but the woman is not experiencing any symptoms associated with a urinary tract infection, such as pain or urgency to urinate. This condition occurs in approximately 2%-10% of pregnant women in the U.S. and can lead to more serious kidney infection as well as increases the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics is advised.

                <h3>Warnings</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>During the first trimester it is important to contact your doctor if you experience any type of vaginal bleeding. The more red in color the blood is, the more significant it is. In addition, if your bleeding is accompanied by pelvic or abdominal pain, you need to contact your doctor. This could be a sign of either an early miscarriage, a threatened miscarriage or even possibly something far more dangerous, such as an ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes. If you have severe nausea and vomiting and you can’t keep anything down, you feel dizzy or light headed, you need to contact your doctor as you may need hospitalization and IV fluid hydration. If you have burning on your urination, this could manifest as a bladder infection. And if untreated, this can lead to significant complications with your pregnancy. Finally, if you’re having any type of unusual vaginal discharge or fevers, you should also contact your doctor to be ruled out for sexually transmitted diseases and infection that could affect the health of your baby.</p>
