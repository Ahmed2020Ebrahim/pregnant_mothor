            <p>You are in the third trimester of your pregnancy and the excitement of the coming due date is bound to keep you smiling all day! There are certain symptoms that will occur during this stage and the best way to overcome them is to eat the right kind of foods.
            As with other stages in your pregnancy, there are foods that you should have plenty of and foods that you should avoid at this time of your life. Make sure that you eat healthy and avoid the wrong diet; it is a guaranteed way to ensure that your baby develops and grows properly.
            Plus, you also get the nutrients that you need to keep you strong when you finally give birth to your bundle of joy! 7th Month Of Pregnancy Diet
            During the third trimester of your pregnancy, the diet that you consume should be focused on the health of your baby who is to arrive soon. You should consume foods that provide you with approximately 450 extra calories on a daily basis.
            The key is – in moderation! Instead of eating a large meal at once, have small portions throughout the day to give your baby the nutrition she needs to grow. Here are foods that you should eat during this stage of your pregnancy:
            </p>
            <strong>1. Iron And Protein-Rich Foods:</strong>
            <p>During your third trimester, extra iron is important to avoid anaemia, hemorrhage during delivery. You need around 27 mg of iron daily. Get your required dose of iron and protein from foods like red meat, beans, poultry, seeds and rice. The amino acids that you get from protein you consume will aid in the rapid growth of your little one.</p><br>
            <strong>2. Calcium Rich Foods:</strong>
            <p>Calcium is important throughout your pregnancy; however, it is especially crucial during the third trimester, since calcium arrangement in your baby’s skeleton takes place. Experts recommend a minimum of 1,000 mg of calcium as the daily intake. Dairy products such as milk, yogurt and foods like oatmeal and salmon are rich sources of calcium.</p><br>
            <strong>3. Magnesium Rich Foods:</strong>
            <p>Magnesium will help in absorbing the calcium that you consume and also provides relief from leg cramps, helps in relaxing your muscles and prevents premature labor. You should take in approximately 350 to 400 mg of magnesium every day. Almonds, oat bran, black beans, barley, artichoke, pumpkin seeds, etc., are rich sources of magnesium.</p><br>
            <strong>4. Foods With DHA:</strong>
            <p>DHA is a fatty acid that helps your baby’s brain in developing properly. Experts recommend about 200 mg on a daily basis. You can find DHA in foods such as milk, eggs and juices.</p><br>
            <strong>5. Folic Acid:</strong>
            <p>Consumption of folic acids is a must to every pregnant mother, before and during pregnancy. During the third trimester, folic acid helps decrease the risk of defects of your baby’s neural tube. You can find folic acid in foods that include grains like oatmeal, collards or dark leafy vegetables and fruits like strawberries and oranges. You should get about 600-800 mg every day.</p><br>
            <strong>6. Fibre-Rich Foods:</strong>
            <p>To prevent constipation, which is one of the common symptoms of third trimester, you should consume plenty of fibre-rich foods. You should include vegetables, fruits (fresh and dried), legumes and whole grains in your diet. Do not forget that the water in your digestive tract is rapidly absorbed by fibre, so drink plenty of water and other fluids to replenish your body.</p><br>
            <strong>7. Foods Rich In Vitamin C:</strong>
            <p>To make sure that the iron you take in is properly absorbed in your body, you should eat foods that are rich in vitamin C. Rich sources of this vitamin include citrus fruits such as melons, lemons, and oranges as well as green pepper and broccoli.</p><br>

                <h3>Drinks</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Experts are still unsure exactly how much – if any – alcohol is completely safe for you to have while you're pregnant, so the safest approach is not to drink at all while you're expecting.</p>
            <h3>Is it safe to drink alcohol when pregnant?</h3>
            <p>The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum.
            Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink, the greater the risk.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does alcohol affect my unborn baby?</h3>
            <p>When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta and to your baby.
            A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop and does not mature until the later stages of pregnancy.
            Your baby cannot process alcohol as well as you can, and too much exposure to alcohol can seriously affect their development.
            Drinking alcohol, especially in the first 3 months of pregnancy, increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and your baby having a low birthweight.
            Drinking after the first 3 months of your pregnancy could affect your baby after they're born.
            The risks are greater the more you drink. The effects include learning difficulties and behavioural problems.
            Drinking heavily throughout pregnancy can cause your baby to develop a serious condition called foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
            Symptoms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>poor growth</li>
                <li>distinct facial features</li>
                <li>learning and behavioural problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drinking less heavily, and even drinking heavily on single occasions, may be associated with lesser forms of FAS. The risk is likely to be greater the more you drink.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How to avoid alcohol in pregnancy</h3>
            <p>It may not be as difficult as you think to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy, as many women go off the taste of alcohol early in pregnancy.
            Most women do give up alcohol once they know they're pregnant or when they're planning to become pregnant.
            Women who find out they're pregnant after already having drunk in early pregnancy should avoid further drinking.
            However, they should not worry unnecessarily, as the risks of their baby being affected are likely to be low.
            If you're concerned, talk to a midwife or doctor.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>What is a unit of alcohol?</h3>
            <p>If you do decide to drink when you're pregnant, it's important to know how many units you are consuming.
            One UK unit is 10 millilitres (ml) – or 8 grams – of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>just under half a pint of cider (218ml) at 4.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label)</li>
                <li>just under half a pint of beer (250ml) at 4% ABV</li>
                <li>a single measure of spirit (25ml), such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV</li>
                <li>just under half a standard glass of wine (76ml) at 13% ABV</li>
            </ul><br><br><br>

            <h3>Week 25: Straighten up! Exercise to improve your posture</h3>
            <p>Sure, it's not easy standing up straight (at least, as straight as Mom would like) when you've got a basketball strapped to your belly. At 25 weeks pregnant, your posture takes hits for a couple of reasons: first, your baby's weight causes your lower back to sway as your center of gravity shifts forward; second, your stomach muscles stretch (and stretch) as baby grows, becoming less able to contract and keep your lower back in alignment. To compensate (and make Mom happy), strengthen your abs (with such exercises as the standing pelvic tilt), which reduces pressure on your lower back.</p><br>
            <h3>Week 26: Watch your balance during pregnancy</h3>
            <p>It's not just what you do, it's what you do it on. To lessen impact on your loosened-up joints and ligaments at 26 weeks pregnant, opt for a wood floor or carpet over tile or concrete when exercising indoors. Outside, choose a soft running track or a dirt trail over a hard road or sidewalk, but avoid bumpy paths, as your balance (you might have noticed) isn't what it used to be.</p><br>
            <h3>Week 27: Don't overdo it</h3>
            <p>Every baby responds differently to Mom's exercise routine. Some may be lulled to sleep by the movement, while others might seem to start a workout of their own ("Look, Mom, I can kickbox, too!"). How do you know how much workout is too much for baby? At 27 weeks pregnant, a kick count can tell you: After the 27th to 28th weeks, your baby should move two to three times within the first 30 minutes post-exercise (after he or she has woken from that nap).</p>

            <p>During the last trimester of pregnancy your doctor may recommend that you have certain diagnostic tests. These tests are all safe and have been developed to ensure the optimum well-being of both mother and baby.
            Listed are some of the most common tests women who are pregnant will given.
            </p><br>
            <strong>Group B streptococcus screening</strong>
            <p>Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacteria that can exist in the female reproductive tract without causing symptoms. Up to 30% of healthy women can carry group B strep, and it usually does not cause problems. However, sometimes it can lead to serious infection of the bloodstream, infection of the placenta, or urinary tract infection. Group B strep can also have serious consequences for the baby, causing potentially life-threatening infections in the newborn, including meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis. Testing is simple and involves taking a sample from the vagina and from the rectum with a cotton swab. The swab is cultured in the laboratory to determine if group B strep is present. If the test is positive, you will be given antibiotics during labor to reduce the chances of infection in the baby. The test is usually done between the 35th and 37th weeks of pregnancy and should be done in subsequent pregnancies even if you test negative in your first pregnancy. Electronic fetal heart rate monitoring</p><br>
            <p>Electronic fetal heart rate monitoring is often done to confirm that the baby is healthy. This type of monitoring is also done during labor and delivery. It can be done any time after the 20th week of gestation during prenatal checkups.</p><br>

            <p>Heartburn, swelling of hands and feet, fatigue and constipation are some of the symptoms that you will go through during the third trimester of your pregnancy.
            To avoid these symptoms, eliminate certain foods from your 7th month of pregnancy diet. This will help in relieving any discomfort and provide your baby get the proper nutrition.. Here are foods that you should avoid in diet during 7th month of pregnancy:
            </p>

            <p>To make sure that you do not have to go through the discomfort of heartburn, you should stay away from fried foods that are high in fat content. You should also avoid spicy foods as they too contribute to heartburn. Experts recommend eating a light meal for dinner.</p><br>
            <strong>2. Sodium-Packed Foods:</strong>
            <p>Bloating and swelling can be prevented by drinking plenty of fluids. You should always drink plenty of water. Reducing your intake of sodium is also important so keep away from foods high in salt content such as chips, ketchup, canned foods, pickles and sauces, to name a few.</p><br>
            <strong>3. Caffeine, Alcohol And Tobacco:</strong>

Caffeinated beverages can cause constipation and make you feel uncomfortable especially at this stage of your pregnancy, so it is best to keep them off your daily diet. Alcohol and tobacco are of course very harmful for your baby so quit while you can!</p><br>
            <strong>4. Junk Foods:</strong>
            <p>A small portion of junk food when you have cravings is perfectly alright; however, it is important to remember not to overdo it. Processed foods do not have nutritive value. It is best to make healthy homemade snacks like carrot sticks, sandwiches with whole-grain breads, etc. This way, you fill your stomach and give your baby the nutrition to grow healthily.
            Eating a balanced and healthy diet is an important part of pregnancy, as it not only gives you strength and nutrition, but also benefits your baby. Apart from a healthy diet, it is also important for you to do light or moderate exercises every day.
            Prenatal yoga, walking and swimming are great activities to prevent fast and excessive weight gain and also help in keeping you strong and fit for delivery. When you make sure that you take care of yourself, you also take care of your little one before he or she comes into this world!
