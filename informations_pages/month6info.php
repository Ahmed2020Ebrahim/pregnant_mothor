                <h3>Drinks</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Experts are still unsure exactly how much – if any – alcohol is completely safe for you to have while you're pregnant, so the safest approach is not to drink at all while you're expecting.</p>
            <h3>Is it safe to drink alcohol when pregnant?</h3>
            <p>The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum.
            Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink, the greater the risk.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does alcohol affect my unborn baby?</h3>
            <p>When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta and to your baby.
            A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop and does not mature until the later stages of pregnancy.
            Your baby cannot process alcohol as well as you can, and too much exposure to alcohol can seriously affect their development.
            Drinking alcohol, especially in the first 3 months of pregnancy, increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and your baby having a low birthweight.
            Drinking after the first 3 months of your pregnancy could affect your baby after they're born.
            The risks are greater the more you drink. The effects include learning difficulties and behavioural problems.
            Drinking heavily throughout pregnancy can cause your baby to develop a serious condition called foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
            Symptoms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>poor growth</li>
                <li>distinct facial features</li>
                <li>learning and behavioural problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drinking less heavily, and even drinking heavily on single occasions, may be associated with lesser forms of FAS. The risk is likely to be greater the more you drink.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How to avoid alcohol in pregnancy</h3>
            <p>It may not be as difficult as you think to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy, as many women go off the taste of alcohol early in pregnancy.
            Most women do give up alcohol once they know they're pregnant or when they're planning to become pregnant.
            Women who find out they're pregnant after already having drunk in early pregnancy should avoid further drinking.
            However, they should not worry unnecessarily, as the risks of their baby being affected are likely to be low.
            If you're concerned, talk to a midwife or doctor.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>What is a unit of alcohol?</h3>
            <p>If you do decide to drink when you're pregnant, it's important to know how many units you are consuming.
            One UK unit is 10 millilitres (ml) – or 8 grams – of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>just under half a pint of cider (218ml) at 4.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label)</li>
                <li>just under half a pint of beer (250ml) at 4% ABV</li>
                <li>a single measure of spirit (25ml), such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV</li>
                <li>just under half a standard glass of wine (76ml) at 13% ABV</li>
            </ul><br><br><br>

           <h3>Week 21: Don't get stiff: Get moving!</h3>
           <p>If you spend long hours sitting on the job at 21 weeks pregnant (or even if you're on your feet all day), it's easy to become a working stiff — literally. So brake for a five- or 10-minute break at least once an hour — take a short stroll down the corridor (you know you need to pee anyway), or do a series of standing stretches (touch your toes while you can still see them!). Do the same during couch-potato sessions at home too. When you're stuck in your chair, try this exercise to get your blood moving: Extend your leg, flex your feet, and wiggle your toes while taking a few deep breaths. And don't forget to flex your neck from side to side occasionally, too.</p><br><br>
           <h3>Week 22: Constipated while pregnant? Work it out!</h3>
           <p>Is the plumbing clogged at 22 weeks pregnant? Then start working out. Both during pregnancy and in those first postpartum weeks, physical activity is one of the best ways to stimulate your bowels and fight constipation. Even just a half-hour walk a day can do the trick — especially if you drink plenty of water and favor fiber-rich foods (so take some trail mix on the trail).</p><br><br>
           <h3>Week 23: Work out to boost baby's brain</h3>
           <p>Scientific research shows that you may not be the only one who benefits from pregnancy exercise. Preliminary studies suggest that babies of moms who exercise through pregnancy may score higher on some language and vocabulary tests during childhood. </p><br><br>
           <h3>Week 24: Pilates during pregnancy — try it</h3>
           <p>Everybody (and their pregnant neighbor) is doing it — but is Pilates the right exercise for you? Absolutely — and it's not a stretch! This mind-body discipline focuses on strengthening your core and elongating your muscles, increasing tone, strength, and flexibility — making it perfect when you're exercising for two at 24 weeks pregnant. Choose a pregnancy Pilates class if you can, or let your instructor know you're expecting so she can modify or eliminate any inappropriate positions or movements.</p><br><br>

           <p>Your medical visit this month will be similar to that of previous months. Your health-care provider will check the following:</p>

              <li> blood pressure</li>

           </ul>
           <h3>Medical tests in the sixth month of pregnancy</h3>
           <p>It is recommended that all pregnant women be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If your health-care provider determines that you are high risk for gestational diabetes, they may request the test as early as 13 weeks. In the screening test, you will be asked to drink a special high-glucose fluid, and one hour later, some blood will be drawn and tested. If the results are borderline positive for gestational diabetes, you will be asked to do a second screening test.

           <h3>6th Month Of Pregnancy Diet – What To Avoid?</h3>
           <p>Many women often have cravings for rather unhealthy foods while they are pregnant. While it is okay to indulge moderately in some junk food, there are certain foods that should be avoided at all costs while you are pregnant, especially up to your 6th month.
            Here are some of the foods that are an absolute no-no during your pregnancy:
            </p>
           <strong>1. Raw Seafood:</strong>
           <p>You may have a sudden hankering for sushi but avoid it at all costs! As raw fish carry high level of methylmercury, that can cause food-borne diseases like listeriosis which can be dangerous for your unborn baby.</p><br>
           <strong>2. Undercooked Meat:</strong>
           <p>Always make sure that you cook your meat well as the bacteria mentioned above can be present in meat that is undercooked. If you are cooking meat for a meal, take care to cook it well so that you can digest it easily and also avoid the risk of listeriosis. Try and avoid eating meat outside.</p><br>
           <strong>3. Non-Pasteurized Cheeses:</strong>
           <p>Avoid soft cheeses that are not pasteurized and stick to hard cheeses only during your pregnancy, especially during your 6th month. Disease-causing bacteria can also be present in this type of cheese so omit it from your diet.</p><br>
           <strong>4. Spicy Food:</strong>
           <p>There will be times when you want to eat something hot and spicy; however, it is best to avoid anything that is too spicy. It can cause your stomach to burn and cause indigestion and great discomfort. It is also not one of the best flavors to give your baby, so curb your cravings for anything too spicy.</p><br>
           <strong>5. Caffeine:</strong>
           <p>Needless to say, it is best to avoid caffeinated beverages such as coffee and aerated drinks. It is a much healthier option to drink herbal tea as it will sooth and calm you, which is exactly what you need while you are pregnant. Then again, check with your doctor, as some women are put off green or herbal tea during pregnancy.</p><br>
           <strong>6. Alcohol And Tobacco:</strong>
           <p>It is no secret that you need to completely stay away from alcohol and tobacco while you are pregnant. The damage done to your baby can be irreparable, even fatal, when you smoke or drink during pregnancy.</p><br><br><br>
           <h3>Remember:</h3>
           <p>Apart from these foods, you should also avoid taking any over the counter medication. If you have a condition that requires you to take medication, consult your doctor and find out if it is safe to be taken while you are pregnant. Only the medicines and supplements prescribed by your doctor should be taken and it is of utmost importance to find out if any other medicines you are taking are safe for your baby. Make sure you make it very clear to your doctor that you are pregnant.</p>
           <p>Eating a balanced diet and providing your body and your baby with all the essential nutrients required should be your primary goal. When you make sure that what you take in on a daily basis is healthy and beneficial for your baby’s development and growth, you ensure that your baby grows up to be a bouncing, healthy little angel!<br>
            Stay healthy and take care of yourself as well as your baby. A healthy mother delivers a healthy baby, so remember your health is of utmost importance too!
