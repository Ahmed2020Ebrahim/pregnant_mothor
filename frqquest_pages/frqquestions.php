                        <h3>Help! I’m feeling nervous about my pregnancy. What can I do?</h3>
                        <p>Don’t be afraid to reach out to others and express your concerns. “Talk with your partner, family or friends about how you are feeling. Keeping your feelings bottled up will only make you feel worse,” says the Office on Women’s Health (womenshealth.gov). Take time to speak to your partner, your family and friends and let them know you’re nervous. Building a support network now will help you throughout your pregnancy. Share your questions, concerns and excitement with your support network and you may be surprised how many mom friends and family members felt the same way you do now. And, chances are, those moms-in-the-know have advice you can use, too.<br>
                            Also, learn as much as you can about pregnancy. Check out books from your library, explore reputable medical resources online, and be sure to speak with your doctor. “By educating yourself, you will know what to expect and feel more in control,” assures the OWH.

                        <h3>Do I really need to take a prenatal vitamin??</h3>
                        <p>This is a good question for you and your doctor to discuss. But most OB-GYNs and pediatricians suggestion expectant moms take a prenatal vitamin containing folic acid throughout their pregnancy. As the U.S. Public Health Service explains, “all women capable of becoming pregnant (should) consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs).”</p>

                        <h3>How many appointments will I need throughout my pregnancy?</h3>
                        <p>Prenatal care during pregnancy is absolutely essential. “This consistent care can help keep you and your baby healthy, spot problems if they occur, and prevent problems during delivery,” explains the OWH.

Routine checkups usually occur:

Once each month, from week four through week 28

Twice a month, from week 28 through week 36

Weekly from week 36 until you give birth.
The above schedule may change slightly, depending on your pregnancy and your OB-GYN’s practice policies. Be sure to speak with you doctor for a complete schedule of your prenatal appointments.

                        <h3>How many ultrasounds will I have?</h3>
                        <p>Ultrasound exams can be performed at any point during pregnancy, but they aren’t always considered a routine prenatal test. Most OB-GYNs suggest moms-to-be have at least two:

The first test usually occurs during your first trimester as part of a biophysical profile (a prenatal ultrasound evaluation).

The second is typically scheduled between 18 and 20 weeks, “to look for signs of problems with the baby's organs and body systems and confirm the age of the fetus and proper growth,” says the OWH.

                        <p>The Office of Women’s Health reports that you can indeed exercise throughout your pregnancy. “Unless your doctor tells you not to, try to get at least two hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week,” the OWH advises.

To maximize the health benefits of working out during pregnancy, and to keep you and your baby safe, spread out your workouts throughout the week. “If you worked out regularly before pregnancy, you can keep up your activity level as long as your health doesn’t change and you talk to your doctor about your activity level throughout your pregnancy,” adds the OWH.

                        <h3>How much weight should I gain during pregnancy?</h3>
                        <p>“You should gain weight gradually during your pregnancy, with most of the weight gained in the last three months,” according to the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion.

The government agency suggests women gain weight at the following rate:

1 to 4 pounds total during the first three months (first trimester)

2 to 4 pounds per month during the fourth to ninth months (second and third trimesters)
The total amount you gain during pregnancy depends on your weight at the time of conception. For women who maintained a healthy preconception weight, the USDA suggests gaining between 25 and 35 pounds. Be sure to speak with you doctor to find out what rate and amount of weight gain are right for you.

                        <p>Clock your contractions to track when they start, how long they last and time between each. This is a good indicator of how soon the first stages of labor will start. “With true labor, contractions become regular, stronger and more frequent,” says the OWH. These contractions will also establish a regular pattern and not taper off or go away, even if you change position or alter your activity.

“If you ever are unsure if contractions are true labor, call your doctor,” recommends the OWH. A quick phone chat will ease your mind and help you understand if you need to stay home and wait a bit longer, or jump in the car and head to the hospital.

Many pregnant women have a lot of questions for their obstetrician-gynecologists, especially if it's the first time they're expecting a child. A significant change is happening in a woman's body during this special period in her life, so it's no wonder so many of us have so many questions. Women want to know what's safe for their future baby, and themselves. They strive to understand in what ways their lives can continue as normal, and what aspects need to be changed for the time being.

Of course, many of the questions pregnant women ask are similar. They're concerned with what foods are safe to eat, which procedures to undergo, and what the basic no-nos are. To make sure that her own and her future baby's health are under no risk, every woman has to know the answers to all these questions. For example, she needs to know that it's better to stay away from eating sushi, always use sunblock, take necessary vitamins, sleep on the side, and avoid taking painkillers or sleeping pills. All these things are vital to remember for the healthy development of a baby.

So let us answer some of the most common pregnancy-related inquiries with the help of professional obstetricians and gynecologists, AKA OB-GYNs!

                        <h3>I'm Going To My First Check-Up. What Should I Expect?</h3>
                        <p>When a pregnant woman comes to a check-up for the first time, she can expect to have a lengthy appointment. It's likely to include a medical history review, a blood and urine test, pap smear, and a general health check to make sure that the woman has no problems with her overall health.

The specialist will also want to discuss the woman's lifestyle and dietary habits and inform her of the changes she has to implement to ensure proper growth of the baby.

                        <h3>Can I Continue To Workout?</h3>
                        <p>Of course, it is vital for a pregnant woman to stay active and fit. Exercising helps a woman relieve some of her discomforts and helps her get energized.

It's advised to choose specific kinds of physical exercises, depending on the trimester and the woman's health condition. Usually, it's safe to do yoga, Pilates, tai chi, aqua aerobics, and dancing (unless the doctor advises otherwise). Contact sports and activities with shaking or jumping movements aren't recommended.

Also, remember that it's unsafe to take a new kind of sports during pregnancy. Therefore, it's better to continue with the exercises that a mom-to-be is used to doing.

                        <h3>Do I Have To Take Any Vitamins?</h3>
                        <p>Even though some women think that it's enough to eat a lot of fresh fruits and veggies during pregnancy, specialists recommend taking supplements as well. Pregnancy isn't easy on the body. Just think about it: there's a brand new organism growing inside the body, and this organism needs a lot of vitamins and minerals for healthy growth.

Therefore, to ensure that the baby gets enough of everything it needs, a woman should at least take additional calcium, folic acid, and iron. Of course, the exact kind of supplements to take has to be discussed with an OB-GYN, because different women might require different formulations.

                        <h3>What Should I Do If I Have A Headache?</h3>
                        <p>It's common for pregnant women to have headaches. Most often, they don't signify any issues and happen due to hormonal changes. But whatever the reason for their occurrence, no woman likes to tolerate the pain.

Specialists don't recommend taking painkillers during pregnancy (especially aspirin, and especially in the first trimester). Therefore, it's better to relieve headaches using natural remedies, such as by massage. A woman should also eat well and watch her posture to prevent the pain.

If a headache is unbearable, the doctor might allow taking paracetamol. It's safer for pregnant women.

                        <p>How Can I Prevent Or Relieve Heartburn?
It's common for pregnant women to have headaches. Most often, they don't signify any issues and happen due to hormonal changes. But whatever the reason for their occurrence, no woman likes to tolerate the pain.

Specialists don't recommend taking painkillers during pregnancy (especially aspirin, and especially in the first trimester). Therefore, it's better to relieve headaches using natural remedies, such as by massage. A woman should also eat well and watch her posture to prevent the pain.

If a headache is unbearable, the doctor might allow taking paracetamol. It's safer for pregnant women.

Heartburn is also common for pregnant women. It happens because the uterus is growing and the production of progesterone is increasing, which results in more relaxed stomach muscles and more acid in the esophagus.

Certain tricks can be used to prevent or relieve this unpleasant condition, and most work by reducing the acid flow. A woman can eat smaller and more frequent meals, drink ginger root tea once in a while, take short walks after meals, wear loose clothes, and keep her chest and head elevated while sleeping.

                        <h3>How Can I Relieve Constipation?</h3>
                        <p>About half of pregnant women frequently suffer from constipation. Like other issues, it can also be caused by hormonal changes in the body. Some of these changes make food go through the digestive systems more slowly, and it results in this bathroom discomfort.

To prevent this unpleasant problem, the woman should drink plenty of water and fruit juices every day, eat high-fiber foods (such as cereals, fruits, and veggies), and exercise regularly. It's better not to drink soda, tea, or coffee, because they contribute to dehydration.

                        <h3>How Should I Eat During Pregnancy?</h3>
                        <p>How Should I Eat During Pregnancy?
Most people know that a pregnant woman's diet needs to be healthy. However, some women think that since a new human being is growing inside of them, they need to eat for two people, but it's better to eat in moderation.

In other words, pregnancy is certainly not the time for dieting, but it's also not the time to eat whatever a woman wants in whatever quantities. Weight gain is unavoidable during this period, but it mustn't be extreme. So better put down the third bar of chocolate!

                        <h3>What Foods Should I Avoid?</h3>
                        <p>There are plenty of foods a pregnant woman should avoid. This includes any raw or undercooked meats and seafood because they contain harmful bacteria. These bacterias won't do anything bad for other people but can be dangerous for a pregnant woman and her future baby.

                        It's also better to avoid eating sushi that contains raw fish and opt for vegetarian options of this dish (in case a woman can't live nine months without it), as well as chocolate mousse, homemade ice-cream, mayonnaise, and other products that have uncooked eggs in them. Remember that eggs are okay during pregnancy, but only if they're well-cooked.</p>

                        <h3>Is Honey Safe For Me And The Baby?</h3>
                        <p>Is Honey Safe For Me And The Baby?
Honey is unsafe for babies aged under 1 year because it contains the bacteria that can cause food poisoning at this early age.

But during pregnancy, the future mother can eat honey (if it's pasteurized) without creating any risk for her unborn baby. In fact, it can even be useful for pregnant women, because it boosts the immune system and provides temporary relief in cases of insomnia. So don't be afraid of eating it once in a while. Just remember that moderation is the key.

                    <div>
                        <h3>Will I Give My Baby An Allergy If I Eat Peanut Butter?</h3>
                        <p>Some pregnant women avoid eating peanut butter because they don't want to cause an allergy in their future baby. However, this risk exists only if the future mother or father has any food allergies, eczema, hay fever, or asthma. If neither of the parents has these conditions, peanut butter, most likely, won't harm the child.

In the meantime, this issue still hasn't been examined thoroughly. So if you don't mind living without peanut butter for nine months, don't eat it, just to be on the safe side.

                    <div>
                        <h3>Can I Take Sleeping Pills If I Struggle To Sleep?</h3>
                        <p>Most specialists don't recommend that women take sleeping pills at all while they're expecting a child because they can cause serious harm to the developing baby.

For this reason, it's better to do everything to prevent insomnia. Avoid drinking caffeine four to six hours before bedtime. If you like tea, better replace it with chai (it's black tea with spices, milk, and sugar) or just drink warm milk with honey instead. Take a warm (not hot!) bath with candles before going to bed and keep your bedroom quiet, dark, and cool. It's very likely that insomnia won't bother you anymore with these tricks.

                        <h3>Can I Swim In A Chlorine Pool?</h3>
                        <p>Large amounts of chlorine can be extremely dangerous for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby, but it doesn't mean that pregnant women cannot swim in a swimming pool during this period. In fact, swimming and aqua-aerobics can be very useful activities for pregnant women, because they help relieve the tension on the back and other joints.

For this reason, pregnant women aren't forbidden from swimming, but it's better to take caution and avoid swimming in a pool when chlorine has just been added to it.

                        <h3>Can I Change My Cat's Litter Box?</h3>
                        <p>If you have anyone else who can change the litter box for you, better ask them to do it. What creates the concern with cat feces is the infection they can transmit. It's called toxoplasmosis. Those who had this infection become immune to it throughout the lifetime, but the problem is that few people actually know that they had it. And if a woman gets toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, it can cause serious birth defects in a baby.

But don't be too scared of it. You don't have to give your cat away the minute you get pregnant. It's unlikely that indoor cats have toxoplasmosis. But avoid dealing with your pet's feces to be on the safe side.

                        <h3>Is It Safe To Garden?</h3>
                        <p>If you like working in the garden, you can continue doing it during pregnancy. But, like  any other activity, you need to be careful and avoid overdoing it.

Important safety measures to keep in mind include wearing gloves and, perhaps, a mask, to avoid different kinds of infections that can be transmitted through the soil and plants. For example, neighborhood cats could have had a stroll in your yard and left their feces in the soil, and you know why it's risky from the previous entry. So remember about safety and work in the garden as much as you like.

                        <h3>I Love Sitting By The Fire. Can I Keep Doing It?</h3>
                        <p>Sitting by the fire doesn't cause any harm to a pregnant woman. Besides, it can even be good, because looking at the flames has a soothing and stress-relieving effect on any person.

But, again, don't overdo with it. If there's too much smoke around, it's better to sit a bit farther to avoid inhaling it. It's also better to keep away from overheating during pregnancy. Therefore, just like most other things, sitting by the fire is good for expecting women, if it's done moderately.

                    <div>
                        <h3>Do I Need To Avoid Any Cosmetics?</h3>
                        <p>No one can blame a pregnant woman from wanting to look beautiful, so it's impossible to force her to avoid all beauty products. However, it's better to choose and use them wisely.

Some cosmetic products (including makeup, shampoo, etc) contain potentially harmful ingredients such as parabens, artificial fragrances, exfoliants, and accutane, so it's highly recommended to avoid the items that contain them. Doing facials is good, but only if it doesn't contain any chemical peels or aromatherapy oils.

Opt for natural, organic beauty products that don't have particular smells, and everything will be fine.

                       <h3>Is It Unsafe To Sleep On My Back?</h3>
                       <p>Yes, sleeping on the back can be unsafe in the second or third trimester, because the uterus and the baby are growing and their increasing weight can press the main vein that carries blood from the woman's lower body area to her heart. If this vein remains pressed for a prolonged period of time, blood circulation to the fetus can become hampered, and it may prevent proper development of the baby.

It's better for pregnant women to sleep on the side. Specialists also recommend putting "a thin pillow under your right side and tilt your body to the left" to decrease the compression of blood vessels.

                       <h3>Will I Have Stretch Marks After Giving Birth?</h3>
                       <p>Most women have stretch marks after they give birth. It happens because the body grows during pregnancy and the suddenly turns back to normal after the baby is born. However, it doesn't mean that stretch marks are unavoidable.

If a woman drinks plenty of water during pregnancy, keeps her skin hydrated, and uses moisturizers every day, she can prevent this unpleasant issue.

                       <h3>Is It Safe To Be Intimate With My Husband During Pregnancy?</h3>
                       <p>It's an important question because most women don't want their intimate life to stop while they're pregnant. And, in fact, they don't have to stop it at all.

There are very few (and particular) instances where a doctor may advise a woman from engaging in intimate contact with her partner until the pregnancy is over.
