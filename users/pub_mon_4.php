           <p>Aren’t you glad that your first trimester is finally over? Phew! The second trimester is a beautiful time and people call it the pregnancy honeymoon period. Chances are that by now all that annoying nausea, vomiting, headache, sleepiness, bloating and peeing will go away.
            You will now feel more active, energetic and less anxious; it is during this magical trimester that you will begin to feel the baby’s movements. Believe me, nothing on earth beats that feeling! Towards the end of the second trimester, your belly will also start showing and people’s attention will once again be focused on your welfare.
          </p><br><br>
          <h3>What’s Happening With The Baby?</h3>
          <p>The aim of the second trimester is growth. By the fourth month of pregnancy, your baby is fully formed. Every organ, including brain, kidneys, spinal cord, eyes, toes, fingers, lungs and heart, is formed and fully functional.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The body works hard to calcify the baby’s bones and to fine tune all the organs. Therefore, your fourth month of pregnancy diet needs to be more growth promoting and nourishing. Here are some diet dos and don’ts for your fourth month of pregnancy. The Fourth Month: What To Eat:</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>Here is a plan you can follow during the 4th month of pregnancy diet.</p><br>
          <strong>1. High Fiber:</strong>
          <p>This is the perfect time for you to start building a foundation for freedom from constipation in the later part of pregnancy and also after delivery. Make sure you add lots of fiber in your 4th month pregnancy diet and that too, in each meal. High fiber foods like whole grains, oats and green vegetables. Opt for iron fortified whole wheat bread instead of regular white bread.</p>
          <br><br>
          <strong>2. Essential Fatty Acids:</strong>
          <p>Besides other things, the baby and your body need these acids to lower the risk of premature labor, low birth weight and mental and cognitive retardation in the baby. Ensure that your diet contains sufficient amounts of Omega 3, 6, 9 fatty acids by taking foods like fresh water fish, tinned tuna, nuts and olive oil</p>
          <br><br>
          <strong>3. Dairy Products:</strong>
          <p>Your body, and the baby’s, still needs increasing amounts of calcium. Your doctor will probably prescribe you a vitamin D and calcium pill on entering the fourth month of pregnancy. You can help your baby develop stronger bones by adding at least one liter on milk products per day. Have 2 glasses of milk or 500 gm of curd or 200 gm of paneer. These act as good supplements to your calcium medication.</p><br><br>
          <strong>4. Meats:</strong>
          <p>If your nausea is gone, you can include meat in your diet; but do make sure it is washed and cooked very thoroughly. Undercooked meat may carry deadly viruses and bacteria. If you are tempted (or obligated) to eat out, order tandoori or roasted meat as it is sure to be cooked through and through.</p><br><br>
          <strong>5. Fruits:</strong>
          <p>Fresh fruits are a must throughout pregnancy as they have loads of vitamins and minerals; plus, they are high in water content and/or fiber. The reason why fresh fruits is the absence of preservatives and artificial coloring agents. The fourth month of pregnancy may trigger acidity and heartburn. Therefore, fresh seasonal fruits of different colors should be an integral part of your diet in 4th month of pregnancy.</p><br><br>
          <strong>6. Iron-Rich Foods:</strong>
          <p>The growth spurt of the foetus starting from the fourth month needs more iron. In addition, your body also needs to make 3-6 extra liters of blood for your pregnancy (hence the famed preggers glow!). An iron-rich diet helps you by making more blood and the baby by aiding better growth. Add foods like nuts, dhaals, eggs, dried fruits and whole wheat products to your diet. Also, consult your doctor before starting any iron supplements.</p><br><br>

                <h3>Drinks</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Experts are still unsure exactly how much – if any – alcohol is completely safe for you to have while you're pregnant, so the safest approach is not to drink at all while you're expecting.</p>
            <h3>Is it safe to drink alcohol when pregnant?</h3>
            <p>The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum.
            Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink, the greater the risk.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does alcohol affect my unborn baby?</h3>
            <p>When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta and to your baby.
            A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop and does not mature until the later stages of pregnancy.
            Your baby cannot process alcohol as well as you can, and too much exposure to alcohol can seriously affect their development.
            Drinking alcohol, especially in the first 3 months of pregnancy, increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and your baby having a low birthweight.
            Drinking after the first 3 months of your pregnancy could affect your baby after they're born.
            The risks are greater the more you drink. The effects include learning difficulties and behavioural problems.
            Drinking heavily throughout pregnancy can cause your baby to develop a serious condition called foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
            Symptoms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>poor growth</li>
                <li>distinct facial features</li>
                <li>learning and behavioural problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drinking less heavily, and even drinking heavily on single occasions, may be associated with lesser forms of FAS. The risk is likely to be greater the more you drink.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How to avoid alcohol in pregnancy</h3>
            <p>It may not be as difficult as you think to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy, as many women go off the taste of alcohol early in pregnancy.
            Most women do give up alcohol once they know they're pregnant or when they're planning to become pregnant.
            Women who find out they're pregnant after already having drunk in early pregnancy should avoid further drinking.
            However, they should not worry unnecessarily, as the risks of their baby being affected are likely to be low.
            If you're concerned, talk to a midwife or doctor.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>What is a unit of alcohol?</h3>
            <p>If you do decide to drink when you're pregnant, it's important to know how many units you are consuming.
            One UK unit is 10 millilitres (ml) – or 8 grams – of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>just under half a pint of cider (218ml) at 4.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label)</li>
                <li>just under half a pint of beer (250ml) at 4% ABV</li>
                <li>a single measure of spirit (25ml), such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV</li>
                <li>just under half a standard glass of wine (76ml) at 13% ABV</li>
            </ul><br><br><br>

               <h3>Sports</h3><br><br>
           </div>
           <p>As your body continues to change during your second trimester, you'll need to pay special attention to your workouts to make sure you're exercising the right way. From choosing the best snacks to navigating your increasingly shaky balance, here are the week-by-week tips to stay healthy while safely fitting in fitness. Early pregnancy fatigue may have you dragging, and sometimes you just want to crawl into bed at 14 weeks pregnant. Unless you're sick, give yourself a pep talk and get your butt moving. Figure out what motivates you. Are you trying to manage your weight gain? Stay flexible? Banish a case of the blues? Or just get in shape for delivery? Remind yourself that exercise will help! And don't forget to reward yourself for reaching mini-goals (for example, you worked out five days this week, so treat yourself to a manicure!). The heat's on when you're expecting, thanks to a boost in your metabolism. So when you're dressing for exercise success at 15 weeks pregnant, play it cool. Wear loose, breathable, stretchable clothes…right down to your undies (which should be cotton). Choose a bra — perhaps a sports bra — that provides plenty of support for your larger-than-life breasts, but doesn't pinch once you get moving. If your sneakers are showing their age, replace them now to minimize your chances of injury or falls (while you're at it, make sure you're wearing the right sneakers for your sport). Wearing clothes that look good will make you feel good, too. One of exercise's top selling points is that it burns calories. Baby-builders like you, though, get the guilt-free pleasure of replacing those calories. So 30 minutes before you work out, hit the fridge for a light snack and a drink. Follow up with an encore snack. At 16 weeks pregnant, bananas and orange juice are great options because they contain plenty of potassium, an essential nutrient that's lost when you perspire, plus they offer quick energy. Add a little protein for staying power (a hard-boiled egg or a cheese stick, for instance).</p>

               <h3>Tests</h3><br><br>
           </div>
           
           <p>A number of medical tests may be offered to you this month:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Ultrasound is offered in weeks 16 to 20. Ultrasound uses sound waves to make a picture of the baby in the uterus, which can be seen onscreen. Ultrasound is used to determine the fetus’s age and check for any significant abnormalities. Ultrasound can also confirm the presence of twins and the exact position of the placenta. This test is best done on a full bladder.</li>
            <li>The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test for neural tube defects may be offered around week 16. This test is done as a follow-up to the first trimester combined screening (nuchal translucency ultrasound and a blood test) which would have been done in weeks 11 to 13. The AFP test in week 16 checks the level of AFP in your blood. If the level is high, it could mean your pregnancy is more advanced than originally thought, that you may be carrying twins, or, rarely, that your baby may have spina bifida. If the AFP level is low, it could mean the pregnancy is not as far along as thought or, rarely, that the baby has Down syndrome. If the AFP is abnormal, you will be offered a more detailed ultrasound to look at your baby's spine.</li>
            <li>Integrated prenatal screening may be offered in weeks 15 to 20 as a follow-up to initial integrated prenatal screening which would have been done in weeks 11 to 13. The first integrated prenatal screening done in weeks 11 to 13 would have consisted of a nuchal translucency ultrasound and a blood test. The integrated prenatal screening test in weeks 15 to 20 is another blood test. Integrated prenatal screening is done to determine the chances that a baby will have a chromosomal abnormality such as Down syndrome.</li>
            <li>Amniocentesis tests for abnormal chromosomes in the baby. This test is offered to women who have an ultrasound or screening tests that show a possible problem with the baby. Amniocentesis is also offered to women over age 35 because they have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. A hollow needle is inserted through the abdominal wall into the uterus to draw out some amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid is then tested for abnormalities. There is a small risk of miscarriage with this test.</li>

           <h3>Fourth Month: What NOT To Eat:</h3>
           <p>Though the crucial first trimester is over and you can now look forward to your baby and its antics, there are still some precautions & foods that need to be avoided in your 4th month of pregnancy diet to ensure the safety of the baby  .</p><br><br>
           <h3>1. Soft Cheese:</h3>
           <p>Often these cheeses are made from unpasteurized milk and may harbor harmful bacteria and viruses. Therefore, avoid soft cheeses of all kinds. You can always choose foods containing hard cheese as it has low water content. The low water content makes it less prone to disease causing microorganisms.</p><br><br>
           <h3>2. Maida:</h3>
           <p>Maida or refined flour becomes a major dietary concern in the fourth month as it is difficult to digest and can cause painful constipation. Though constipation in itself is a minor thing, it can cause hemorrhoids post delivery. So, say no to foods like samosas, momos, noodles, etc.</p><br><br>
           <h3>3. Sea Fish:</h3>
           <p>As much as possible, avoid sea fish as they are loaded with methylmercury, a compound that can cause mental retardation in the fetus. If you cannot do without fish, go for fresh water varieties.</p><br><br>
           <h3>4. Street Food:</h3>
           <p>Though it looks very tempting during your food cravings, street food must be steered clear of. There is no guarantee of the cleanliness and freshness of the foodstuffs and the containers. Street food can cause food poisoning and other water-borne diseases like typhoid. So, prepare a plate of that chaat, pakodis, anddahi bhalla at home itself.</p><br><br>
           <h3>5. Excess Of Dried Fruits:</h3>
           <p>Though a cup of dried fruits is good for you, avoid taking too many dried fruits during the fourth month of pregnancy. They are very rich and warm in essence, and for some women, can cause untimely contractions.</p><br><br>
           <h3>6. Licorice:</h3>
           <p>Called mulethi in Hindhi, this otherwise wonderful herb can wreak havoc on the pregnancy by triggering contractions. Therefore avoid licorice and licorice extracts, and remember that some candies, toothpastes and Indian gravies also contain licorice.
            The fourth month of pregnancy is a wonderful time to experience. There are so many new things going on with your body and attitude that this transformation seems almost magical. Do take these precautions, but at the same time – enjoy your pregnancy
            </p><br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not have too much caffeine, as it can increase your baby’s heart rate.</li>
              <li>If you have pets like cats, do not clean the cat litter, as you could contract a parasite from the litter.</li>
              <li>Do not sit in a hot tub or a sauna, as the high heat environment can cause complications in pregnancy.</li>
              <li>Avoid eating meat cooked outside, as you do not know if it is cleaned and cooked properly.</li>
              <li>Don’t drink alcohol, as the foetus can develop fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).</li>
              <li>Do not smoke, as expectant mothers who smoke can deliver babies with low birth weight and are at a greater risk of disabilities.</li>
