            <p>So you have now reached the 8th month of pregnancy and it’s almost time! As you get ready to prepare for the birth, there are some important changes that your body will be going through. While you reach closer to the big day, your body may start showing signs of tiredness and easy fatigue. As your body grows, it may be difficult for you to move around much, and things you were able to do till now may seem tiring and stressful. Changes In The 8th Month
            As you enter the 8th month of your pregnancy, your uterus gets enlarged and creates a lot of pressure on your stomach. Indigestion and heartburn are also common discomforts that you will go through at this stage. Eating small meals throughout the day, eating without rushing and not gaining too much weight can help in decreasing these symptoms. A healthy diet and lifestyle is important during this stage to prevent body aches and pains as well as fatigue. It will also help you immensely in giving birth to a strong and healthy baby.

                <h3>Drinks</h3><br><br>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Experts are still unsure exactly how much – if any – alcohol is completely safe for you to have while you're pregnant, so the safest approach is not to drink at all while you're expecting.</p>
            <h3>Is it safe to drink alcohol when pregnant?</h3>
            <p>The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum.
            Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink, the greater the risk.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does alcohol affect my unborn baby?</h3>
            <p>When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta and to your baby.
            A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop and does not mature until the later stages of pregnancy.
            Your baby cannot process alcohol as well as you can, and too much exposure to alcohol can seriously affect their development.
            Drinking alcohol, especially in the first 3 months of pregnancy, increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and your baby having a low birthweight.
            Drinking after the first 3 months of your pregnancy could affect your baby after they're born.
            The risks are greater the more you drink. The effects include learning difficulties and behavioural problems.
            Drinking heavily throughout pregnancy can cause your baby to develop a serious condition called foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
            Symptoms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>poor growth</li>
                <li>distinct facial features</li>
                <li>learning and behavioural problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drinking less heavily, and even drinking heavily on single occasions, may be associated with lesser forms of FAS. The risk is likely to be greater the more you drink.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How to avoid alcohol in pregnancy</h3>
            <p>It may not be as difficult as you think to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy, as many women go off the taste of alcohol early in pregnancy.
            Most women do give up alcohol once they know they're pregnant or when they're planning to become pregnant.
            Women who find out they're pregnant after already having drunk in early pregnancy should avoid further drinking.
            However, they should not worry unnecessarily, as the risks of their baby being affected are likely to be low.
            If you're concerned, talk to a midwife or doctor.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>What is a unit of alcohol?</h3>
            <p>If you do decide to drink when you're pregnant, it's important to know how many units you are consuming.
            One UK unit is 10 millilitres (ml) – or 8 grams – of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>just under half a pint of cider (218ml) at 4.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label)</li>
                <li>just under half a pint of beer (250ml) at 4% ABV</li>
                <li>a single measure of spirit (25ml), such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV</li>
                <li>just under half a standard glass of wine (76ml) at 13% ABV</li>
            </ul><br><br><br>

            </div>
                
            <h3>Benefits of doing sport and exercise</h3>
            <p>If you are healthy and have an uncomplicated pregnancy, playing sport can help you stay fitter and stronger, prevent excess weight gain and make you feel better mentally. It may also allow you to have a shorter birth and fewer complications.
            Regular exercise also lowers your risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.
            But while pregnant, you’ll need to be more careful as well as avoid certain types of sport.
            </p>
            <h3>Why do I need to be more careful?</h3>
            <p>Although physical activity in pregnancy is safe and good for you, some sports may cause harm to you or your baby. Even in sports that are not risky you may need to make some changes. It’s important to tell your maternity team about any sport you are playing so they can support you.</p><br>
            <h3>Medical conditions that may affect you playing sport</h3>
            <p>Your maternity team may want to monitor your sport or advise you against participating, if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>have problems with your heart, lungs or liver</li>
                <li>have diabetes that is not well controlled</li>
                <li>have bone or joint problems</li>
                <li>have an infectious disease</li>
                <li>are obese or underweight</li>
                <li>have problems with your pregnancy or a previous pregnancy</li>
                <li>have anaemia</li>
                <li>are having a multiple birth (e.g. twins or triplets)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you are exercising, you should stop and see your doctor straight away, if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you have chest pain</li>
                <li>your heart rate is higher than usual</li>
                <li>you have unusual shortness of breath</li>
                <li>your baby’s movements have decreased</li>
                <li>you are having contractions</li>
                <li>you leak or gush fluid from your vagina</li>
                <li>your ankles, hands or face suddenly swell</li>
                <li>you have pain, swelling or redness in your calves</li>
                <li>you have muscle weakness</li>
                <li>you feel dizzy or faint</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sport and your level of fitness</h3>
            <p>If you are not currently active and starting a sport, it’s good to choose one which needs less effort. You could start with 15 minutes per session, building up to 30 minutes of moderate intensity. If you’ve been inactive, it’s also a good idea consult your doctor before starting to play a sport during pregnancy.
            If you are already active, healthy and have an uncomplicated pregnancy, you can continue to play sport unless it is one that should be avoided during pregnancy. However, this is not a good time to set new personal records.
            It’s important for you to stay comfortable and to warm up before and cool down after your sport.
            </p>
            <h3>Sports to avoid</h3>
            <p>You should not play sports that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>make you work very hard or become too hot</li>
                <li>could cause you to fall</li>
                <li>could hit your baby</li>
                <li>have lots of jumping or bouncing</li>
                <li>involve sudden changes in direction</li>
                <li>involve diving or high altitudes</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sport and stages of pregnancy</h3>
            <p>You may need to make some changes as your pregnancy advances.</p>
            <h3>First trimester (1-12 weeks)</h3>
            <p>During this time, try not to overheat so as to protect both yourself and your baby:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid playing sport in high heat or humidity.</li>
                <li>Wear loose, cool clothing.</li>
                <li>Drink plenty of water</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Second and third trimesters (13-40 weeks)</h3>
            <p>
                During this time, the baby moves upwards and is not protected by your pelvis so avoid high impact sports that could hit the baby.
                Your own body weight also moves forward so there is an increased risk of falling. If you feel unsteady or uncomfortable, stop what you’re doing.
                Your ligaments become looser so there is more chance of ligament injuries. Avoid sports that involve heavy weights or sudden movements and changes in direction such as court sports like tennis.
                Your blood pressure may decrease so move more slowly to avoid getting dizzy when changing your posture (for example, from sitting to standing).
                After 16 weeks, avoid activity that involves lying on your back since this affects blood supply to the baby and can make you feel dizzy.
            </p>
            <h3>What sport is recommended?</h3>
            <p>It’s good to do lower-risk activities that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>are non-contact or limited contact</li>
                <li>support your weight, such as swimming and aquanatal exercise classes — but try to avoid being in water that is warmer than 32 degrees Celsius for very long</li>
                <li>allow you to exercise in a straight line rather than suddenly shifting positions</li>
                <li>have a limited chance of you falling</li>
                <li>allow you to exercise at low or moderate intensity</li>
                <li>are designed specifically for pregnancy</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            
            <h3>The nonstress test (NST)</h3>
            <p>The nonstress test (NST) involves a fetal monitor strapped to the mother's abdomen to measure the baby's heart rate as it moves. It is called "nonstress" because no stress is placed on the fetus for the test. This test is sometimes performed on a weekly basis in high-risk pregnancies. It is done after the 28th week of pregnancy, though most often after 32 weeks. Measurements are typically taken for 20 to 30 minutes. A NST may be ordered if you feel the baby is not moving normally, if you are past your due date, or if your doctor wants to ensure that the placenta is healthy and functioning well. There are no known risks of the NST for the mother or the baby.</p><br>
            <strong>A biophysical profile</strong>
            <p>A biophysical profile combines the information from a NST with an ultrasound examination of the baby for a more precise evaluation.</p><br>
            <strong>A contraction stress test (CST)</strong>
            <p>A contraction stress test (CST), like the NST, measures fetal heart rate. However in this test, the baby's heart rate is measured in response to uterine contractions that are elicited by administering oxytocin (Pitocin) or by stimulation of the nipples. The test is sometimes referred to as an oxytocin challenge test. Normally, the flow of blood to the placenta slows during contractions, but if the placenta is functioning well, the baby's heart rate remains stable. If there is poor function of the placenta, the baby's heart rate will temporarily slow after a contraction. Looking at the baby's heart rate in response to uterine contractions can help the doctor estimate how the baby will respond to the stresses experienced during labor.

            <strong>3. Shark, Marlin And Swordfish:</strong>
            <p>These types of fish have high levels of methylmercury which can be detrimental to your unborn baby’s nervous system. If you are going to eat fish, pick the ones that are not too fatty and provide you and your baby the required nutrition.</p><br>
            <strong>4. Soft Cheese:</strong>
            <p>Cheese that have been ripened with mould such as Brie, as well as cheese that has blue veins such as Danish Blue can often contain listeria which is why they should be avoided during pregnancy. If you have a craving for cheese, opt for hard ones like cheddar.</p><br>
